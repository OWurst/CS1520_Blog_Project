# CS1520_Blog_Project
I did this project in CS1520, a web development class, at UPitt. The purpose of this assignment was to create a web app using flask that has multiple endpoints and utilizes a database. To run: configure a virtual environment, install flask and SQLAlchemy, import the database and run app.py.
